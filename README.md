# 509dds-data

Open data, source documents, and analysis for **SEIU Local 509's Disability Determination Services (DDS) chapter** in Massachusetts. Backing dataset for [509dds.com](https://509dds.com).

> ⚠ **Critical disambiguation:** "DDS" in this repo means **Disability Determination Services** — the division within MassAbility (formerly MRC) that adjudicates SSI/SSDI claims for the Social Security Administration. It is **NOT** the Department of Developmental Services (a separate MA agency that serves people with intellectual/developmental disabilities), and **NOT** Vocational Rehabilitation (VR — a different MassAbility program). See [`docs/dds-det-vs-dds-dev.md`](docs/dds-det-vs-dds-dev.md) for the agency disambiguation and [`SCOPE.md`](SCOPE.md) for what belongs in this chapter repo vs. the umbrella [`MassAbility-DB`](https://github.com/Woop91/MassAbility-DB).

## Headline findings

- **VDE headcount: −44%** from 2019 (232) to 2023 (129) per CTHRU payroll — substantiates "unprecedented staffing vacancies" cited in MA's 2025 Annual Report
- **Senior examiner pipeline collapse**: VDE III went from 44 (2019) to 7 (2023)
- **Cost per case: +30%** from 2018 ($568) to 2024 ($1,071) — fewer staff, higher unit cost
- **MA favorable rate: −5.6 pts** from FY20 (45.82%) to FY24 (40.17%) — steepest decline among population-peer states (TN, IN, MD, VA, WA, MO, WI)
- **National processing time: +110%** from FY16 (110 days) to FY24 (231 days), per SSA — backdrop for state-level pain
- **DDS-Det budget cut: −16.7%** from FY24 ($50.8M) to FY25 ($42.3M)
- **Overtime collapse 2023**: agency-wide VDE overtime fell from $954,171 (2022) to $42,645 (2023) — 96% reduction; max single-person OT $13,358 → $534 (per CTHRU; CY 2023 itself is incomplete in CTHRU — 2-week snapshot only — but the OT-zeroing pattern is the anchor metric)
- **2015 OT blitz**: every single-year top-10 OT earner across 2010–2023 occurred in 2015 (max $23,017 — Steven Monis, Grade C). Suggests a pre-reclass backlog clearance push.

## Sources & confidence levels

| Tier | Sources | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Authoritative** | SSA-SA-FYWL.csv, DDS-Net-Accuracy.csv, MA annual reports, SEIU 509 CBA, mass.gov RA process pages, OHO ALJ disposition CSV | Verified against primary publication |
| **Computed** | CE Rate, MER Rate, annual VDE pay max, DDS-Only Total Staff, per-state ALJ allowance rate | Derived arithmetically from authoritative inputs |
| **Browser-fetch pending** | SSA Annual Statistical Supplement Table 5.A1.5, DI ASR sect01c/03/05, BLS OEWS state files, GAO/CBPP PDFs | Bot-blocked from automated fetchers — see [`data/MANUAL-FETCH-NEEDED.md`](data/MANUAL-FETCH-NEEDED.md) |
| **PRR-pending** | Homeless case counts, Total Receipts/Dispositions for some years | Awaiting Public Records Request — see [`prr-templates/`](prr-templates/) |
| **Structurally unavailable** | Per-state DDS budget allocations | SSA publishes DDS budget at national level only (FY25 total: 13,555 work-years). No public document breaks this down by state — verified via FY25 Congressional Justification extract at [`data/ssa/budget/cj-fy25-extracted.md`](data/ssa/budget/cj-fy25-extracted.md). Only obtainable via federal FOIA, not state PRR. |
