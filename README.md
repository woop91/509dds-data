# 509dds-data

Open data, source documents, and analysis for **SEIU Local 509's Disability Determination Services (DDS) chapter** in Massachusetts. Backing dataset for [509dds.com](https://509dds.com).

> ⚠ **Critical disambiguation:** "DDS" in this repo means **Disability Determination Services** — the division within MassAbility (formerly MRC) that adjudicates SSI/SSDI claims for the Social Security Administration. It is **NOT** the Department of Developmental Services (a separate MA agency that serves people with intellectual/developmental disabilities). See [`docs/dds-det-vs-dds-dev.md`](docs/dds-det-vs-dds-dev.md).

## Document ingestion

Use the MarkItDown wrapper before turning PDFs, Office files, or other source documents into parsed data. It writes an auditable bundle containing the original file, generated Markdown, metadata, checksum, and converter warnings.

```bash
npm run ingest:markitdown -- data/source/example.pdf --title "Example Source"
```

See [`docs/markitdown-ingestion.md`](docs/markitdown-ingestion.md).

## Headline findings

- **VDE headcount: −44%** from 2019 (232) to 2023 (129) per CTHRU payroll — substantiates "unprecedented staffing vacancies" cited in MA's 2025 Annual Report
- **Senior examiner pipeline collapse**: VDE III went from 44 (2019) to 7 (2023)
- **Cost per case: +30%** from 2018 ($568) to 2024 ($1,071) — fewer staff, higher unit cost
- **MA favorable rate: −5.6 pts** from FY20 (45.82%) to FY24 (40.17%) — steepest decline among population-peer states (TN, IN, MD, VA, WA, MO, WI)
- **National processing time: +110%** from FY16 (110 days) to FY24 (231 days), per SSA — backdrop for state-level pain
- **DDS-Det budget cut: −16.7%** from FY24 ($50.8M) to FY25 ($42.3M)
- **Overtime collapse 2023**: agency-wide VDE overtime fell from $954,171 (2022) to $42,645 (2023) — 96% reduction; max single-person OT $13,358 → $534 (per CTHRU; CY 2023 itself is incomplete in CTHRU — 2-week snapshot only — but the OT-zeroing pattern is the anchor metric)
- **2015 OT blitz**: every single-year top-10 OT earner across 2010–2023 occurred in 2015 (max $23,017 — Steven Monis, Grade C). Suggests a pre-reclass backlog clearance push.

## Sources & confidence levels

| Tier | Sources | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Authoritative** | SSA-SA-FYWL.csv, DDS-Net-Accuracy.csv, MA annual reports, SEIU 509 CBA, mass.gov RA process pages, OHO ALJ disposition CSV | Verified against primary publication |
| **Computed** | CE Rate, MER Rate, annual VDE pay max, DDS-Only Total Staff, per-state ALJ allowance rate | Derived arithmetically from authoritative inputs |
| **Browser-fetch pending** | SSA Annual Statistical Supplement Table 5.A1.5, DI ASR sect01c/03/05, BLS OEWS state files, GAO/CBPP PDFs | Bot-blocked from automated fetchers — see [`data/MANUAL-FETCH-NEEDED.md`](data/MANUAL-FETCH-NEEDED.md) |
| **PRR-pending** | Homeless case counts, Total Receipts/Dispositions for some years | Awaiting Public Records Request — see [`prr-templates/`](prr-templates/) |
| **Structurally unavailable** | Per-state DDS budget allocations | SSA publishes DDS budget at national level only (FY25 total: 13,555 work-years). No public document breaks this down by state — verified via FY25 Congressional Justification extract at [`data/ssa/budget/cj-fy25-extracted.md`](data/ssa/budget/cj-fy25-extracted.md). Only obtainable via federal FOIA, not state PRR. |

## Security Tooling

This repo runs three security scanners:

- **Semgrep** (SAST) — CI only, on push + PR. Tiered gating: ERROR severity blocks merge, WARNING/INFO are advisory.
- **Gitleaks** (secrets) — pre-commit hook (staged-only) + CI. Any finding blocks.
- **Supabase Database Advisors** — N/A (this repo has no database).

### Bypassing for emergencies

```bash
git commit --no-verify  # skip gitleaks pre-commit (only when justified)
```

CI bypass requires an allowlist commit with a `# why:` comment in `.gitleaks.toml` or `.semgrepignore`.

### Adding an allowlist entry

- Semgrep: add path or rule-id to `.semgrepignore` with a `# why:` comment.
- Gitleaks: add path glob to `.gitleaks.toml` `[allowlist].paths`, or commit SHA to `[[allowlist.commits]]`.

### Secret rotation

If gitleaks fired in CI (or a real secret slipped past pre-commit), follow `docs/security/SECRET-ROTATION-RUNBOOK.md` in order.

### Local scans

Both scanners run via Docker (no global install needed):

```bash
npm run security:scan:gitleaks  # one-shot gitleaks detect
npm run security:scan:semgrep   # one-shot semgrep scan
```

Pre-commit hook fires gitleaks automatically on `git commit`.
